## Assignment 5

**First phase: symmetric behavior**
Initially, Langton's Ant periodically to a pattern that is point-symmetrical around its starting position, such as:
- after 184 iterations:
![[Langton_184.png|300]]

- after 368 iterations:
![[Langton_368.png|300]]

- for the final time after 472 iterations:
![[Langton_472.png|300]]

**Second phase: chaotic behavior**
The symmetric pattern breaks, and the motion of the ant becomes chaotic. There no longer are obvious patterns or symmetries in the grid pattern, though the pattern stays roughly centered around the starting position. The ant does not travel outward too quickly.
Example after 5606 iterations:

**Third phase: periodic behavior**
Eventually, the ant creates a pattern which causes it to have the same orientation and immediate pattern neighborhood, which causes it to travel outward indefinitely:

## Assignment 6

Given the same starting orientation, the behavior on a black plane is identical to the behavior on a white plane, except mirrored:

## Assignment 8
A turing machine:
- has a one-dimensional tape where the input is stored
- can read and write one cell of the tape at a time
- has different behavior depending on the state of the current cell
- writes the output of its program onto the tape.

This is matched by Langton's Ant, with the difference being that instead of a one-dimensional tape, it operates on a two-dimensional grid.
If we allow for changing of the default behavior of Langton's Ant, we could restrict it to only move left and right, and we could alter its state space to match that of any turing machine. Langton's Ant would now behave exactly like a turing machine. 

But even without changing the default behavior, we can implement arbitrary boolean functions using AND- and NOT-gates, as shown in the lecture. The input to this function can be stored directly on the grid, and the output is generated by the Ant by running the simulation. Thereby, Langton's Ant is capable of computing any function, making it turing complete.
